Lioshi Icon Theme
================

Lioshi is a modern freedesktop icon theme whose design is based around the use of bold colours and simple geometric shapes to compose icons. Each icon has been meticulously designed for pixel-perfect viewing.

While it does take some inspiration from the icons in Google's Material Design, some aspects have been adjusted to better suit a desktop environment.

## Missing Icons & Requests

You can file an icon request as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/snwh/lioshi-icon-theme/issues/new). Filing an icon request or reporting a missing icon, please take care in providing the following useful information: 

 - A screenshot of your issue or an image of the original icon you are requesting to be themed
 - The file name for the missing icon or the requested icon, for example `gimp.png` or `system-shutdown.svg`
 - A short description of the application or software that you are requesting an icon for.

Note: some software ships hardcoded icons, meaning when you install icons are not placed in the system-wide directory `/usr/share/icons` which makes them unthemeable.
